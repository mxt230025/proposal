## Description
When you spend a pull you can get an item of varying rarities. This can be a game or utilized as a basic system used by other games that wish to use a gacha system.

## Features
- Gacha pulling system
	- By doing a pull, you are attempting to draw for an item of varying rariety.
- Inventory
	- Open your inventory and see what you have pulled.
- Pity
	- If you don't get a legendary item within a set amount of pulls, you will get it by default.

## Challenges
- Define a list of items with a set rarity.
- Keep track of obtained items.
- Set up a pity system for the unfortunate.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- For every pull that you do, you have the chance to either get a common, epic, or legendary item.
- See a list of items obtained from pulling.
- If you don't get the legendary item, you will get it eventually.
